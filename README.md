# dndcharactermanager

This is an app that helps create, save, and use 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons characters.  The eventual plan is for the app to 
be wholly integrated with the user's character, self updating as the user selects feats, gains items, levels up, etc.  It will eventually
have a dice roller that references the character sheet as well, so you can make an attack roll using the loaded character's modifiers.
